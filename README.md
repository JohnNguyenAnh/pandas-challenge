Based on the spending_summary and size_summary, it appears that larger schools with higher spending tend to have lower passing rates. Additionally, these larger schools seem to be located at a greater distance compared to others.

Examining the type_summary, Charter schools seem to have a greater impact than District schools. Notably, among the top 5 schools, all are Charter type, while the bottom 5 are District type.

To summarize the analysis:
The data suggests a correlation between school's performances. Larger schools with higher spending may face challenges in achieving higher passing rates. Moreover, Charter schools consistently outperform District schools, as evidenced by the distribution of top and bottom-performing schools.
